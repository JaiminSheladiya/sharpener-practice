          eCommerce is an integral part of our global, modern economy. Over the
          past couple of decades, itâ€™s transformed the way we shop, and the way
          we do business. In fact, merchants selling on the Wix eCommerce
          platform saw sales revenues grow 114% year-over-year in 2020, reaching
          $5.4 billion in online transactions.
